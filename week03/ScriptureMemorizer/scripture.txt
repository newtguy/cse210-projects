Mosiah 6:6-7 
And it came to pass that king Mosiah did 
walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe his 
judgements and his statutes, and did keep his 
commandments in all things whatsoever he commanded him.

And king Mosiah did cause his people that they should 
till the earth. And he also, himself, did till the earth, 
that thereby he might not become burdensome to his people, 
that he might do according to that which his father had 
done in all things. And there was no contention among 
all his people for the space of three years.
